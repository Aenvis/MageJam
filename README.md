# MageJam
Unity C# project made in 48h in a 5-member team.

I'm responsible for most of the project structure and code architecture. 
It was my first attempt in genre like that, so it turned out to be quite challenging (poor game performance visible in video speaks for itself)!
It was really amusing and required lots of work and hard thinking, hope you like it! :)
